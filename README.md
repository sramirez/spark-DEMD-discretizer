A Distributed Evolutionary Multivariate Discretizer (DEMD)
==========================================================

Here, a Distributed Evolutionary Multivariate Discretizer (DEMD) for data reduction on Spark is presented. This evolutionary-based discretizer uses binary chromosome representation and a wrapper fitness function. The algorithm is aimed at optimizing the cut points selection problem by trading-off two factors: simplicity of solutions and its classification accuracy.

In order to alleviate the complexity derived from the evolutionary process, the whole phase has been fully parallelized. For this purpose, both the set of chromosomes and instances are split into different partitions and a random cross-evaluation process between them is performed. 

Despite the non-deterministic nature of the algorithm, the evalution results has shown to yield good discretization schemes. A thorough experimental evaluation performed using several huge datasets (up to O(10^7) instances and O(10^4) features) has shown the usefulness of our approach.

## Parameters:

Our distributed approach includes several user-defined input parameters, which are described below:
* train: the raw dataset, in RDD format.
* contFeat: sequence of feature indexes to discretize.
* mvfactor: numerical ratio between the number of feature chunks and the
number of data partitions. It is a integer value, which can be greater
than 1 (default).
* alpha: a weight factor for the fitness function used in the inner evolution-
ary process (range [0, 1]).
* nChr: Number of chromosome evaluations to be performed in each process
(evolutionary algorithm).
* srate: Percentage of sampled instances used to evaluate the candidate
points (range [0, 1]).
* vth: Percentage of points selected in each aggregation process (range
[0, 1]).


## Example: 
	import org.apache.spark.mllib.feature._
  
	val train = /** A RDD of LabeledPoint **/
  	val contFeat = (0 until train.first.features.size) /** Sequence of feature indexes to discretize **/
  	val nChr = 50
  	val ngeval = 5000
  	val mvfactor = 1
  	val alpha = .7f
  	val srate = .1f
  	val vth = 100
              
  	val discretizer = DEMDdiscretizer.train(train,
        	contFeat,
        	nChr,
        	ngeval,
        	alpha,
        	mvfactor,
        	srate,
        	vth) 
    	
	val discretized = data.map(i => LabeledPoint(i.label, discretizer.transform(i.features)))
	discretized.first()
